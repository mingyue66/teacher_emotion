# Method 1: linear 
For each wav file, both systems predict a number between 0 and 1, indicating the probability of being “positive”. Then, a simple linear function combines the two probabilities to produce a final probability. 

P(final probability) = weight1*text model + weight2*acoustic model    (weight1 + weight2 = 1.0)
If P >= 0.5 : positive. Otherwise, negative. 


# Method 2: stacking
Layer 1: MLP trained on text data; MLP trained on acoustic data 
Layer 2: SVC trained on the probabilities predicted by models in layer 1
